# TODO

- Explain RPC endpoints
- Perhaps hint at light clients
- Perhaps touch on async functions, even though we dont use async yet.
- Note in the output of `console.log({ polkadotClient })`:
   - The `getChainSpecData` method
   - The `getFinalizedBlock` method
   - These will be used in the next step
